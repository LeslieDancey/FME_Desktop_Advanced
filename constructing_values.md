# Constructing Values

Constructing Values goes one step further than setting an attribute with a simple, fixed value.

FME has various functions that allow the workspace author to create a simple, fixed value for an attribute.

For example, here an author is using the AttributeCreator transformer to set the value of an existing attribute and to create a new attribute with a fixed value:

However, in many cases the workspace requires a value to be constructed out of a number of existing values, or perhaps an arithmetic calculation, and FME is capable of doing that as well.

There are, basically, two methods to constructing attribute values: Transformer Construction and Integrated Construction.

**Transformer Construction**

Transformer construction is a basic method of constructing attribute values. The author sets simple values in a transformer, but uses two or more transformers in a series in order to build a more complex value.

For example, here the workspace author needs to create a label in their spatial data.

First they create an attribute value by calculating a number, concatenate it onto a string attribute, trim the result, and then use that as the content for a LabelPointReplacer transformer.

This is an acceptable way of working that is self-documenting and easy to understand; but it is also a fairly crude method and results in the use of more transformers than is perhaps necessary.

**Integrated Construction**

Integrated construction is a more elegant method of constructing attribute values. Instead of using a string of transformers, the author uses functionality built into a single transformer’s parameter dialog window.

In short, the attribute value is constructed at its point of use; it’s a more efficient method and reduces the number of transformers cluttering up the workspace canvas.

Most transformer parameters have one of two pieces of inbuilt functionality that allow this to take place: a Text Editor or an Arithmetic Editor.

The text editor allows values to be constructed from strings. It includes access to all FME feature attributes and user parameters, plus special characters, FME Functions, and various string manipulation related functions.

The arithmetic editor allows values to be calculated from arithmetic calculations. Again, it includes access to all FME feature attributes, user parameters, and FME Functions; but additionally it gives access to a series of mathematical functions and operators.

“Although we’re talking about attributes here, the same functionality
applies to any transformer parameter.
For example, the label parameter for the LabelPointReplacer can be
constructed using a text editor instead of a series of transformers.
We’re only discussing it here in terms of “attributes” because traditionally you would
construct an attribute and supply it to the parameter. Now everything is built into that
parameter.”

**Text Editor**

The Text Editor is a tool for string-based construction of attributes. In it, the workspace author can construct values out of fields such as the following:

- String Constants
- FME Feature Attributes
- User or System Parameters
- Special Characters

The text editor window is a free-form dialog into which the author can construct almost any form of string. Here, for example, the author is constructing a string that describes a cell phone tower. Such a string could be applied as a label, written as an attribute value, or used in many other ways.

Constant values can be entered directly into the expression field.

Fixed items are generated by using the left-hand menu. In addition to the ability to use attributes, parameters, and special characters, the advanced editor allows the author to make use of special functions.

These are added to the expression by locating them in the menu and either double-clicking that entry or dragging it into the expression:

FME Feature Functions are the underlying functions used by FME transformers. By accessing these, the author is reaching directly into core FME functionality.

All FME functions are of the form @functionname() where the part inside parentheses is a function parameter.

For example the function @Value(Roads) returns the value of the attribute called Roads.

Not all functions have parameters, or those parameters are not always compulsory; for
example the function @Area() does not need to take a parameter.

“FME functions can be used in the text editor to calculate values on the fly,
instead of using a transformer.
For example, an author wants to create an attribute whose contents
include the area of the feature in the form “<area> sq. metres”
They could calculate the area with an AreaCalculator and use @Value(_area) sq. metres
or they could cut out that transformer and go directly with: @Area() sq. metres”
</span>

The editor also has a set of string functions and mathematical functions. The string functions carry out operations like formatting, extracting, trimming, and padding. The mathematical functions are the usual advanced arithmetic functions such as int, cos, and log.

The string functions are mostly based around Tcl, while the arithmetic functions around C.

**Arithmetic Editor**

The Arithmetic Editor dialog is a tool for building arithmetic expressions.

Like the text editor, the arithmetic editor has the ability to calculate values using constant values, feature attributes, parameters, and other functions.

However, the arithmetic editor works entirely with numbers to calculate a numeric value. The implications of this are:

- All attribute values used must be numeric, or converted to numeric inside the expression by using a function.
- The only FME functions and string functions available are those that return a numeric
value; for example @Area(), @Count(), and @StringLength()
- The value returned to the workspace will be a numeric type, not a string.

For example, here a workspace author is calculating the property tax for a set of features using the attributes TaxBand and AssessedValue, in conjunction with the @Area() function.

“At this point two questions are probably uppermost in your mind.
Firstly, why do some transformer parameters have options for both the
text and arithmetic editor (like the AttributeCreator) whereas others have
just the text editor or just the arithmetic editor?
That’s easy. The editor is matched to the type of value expected by that parameter. For
example, the LabelPointReplacer transformer has Label and Label Height parameters.
The Label parameter can access the text editor, because it expects a string. The Label
Height parameter can access the arithmetic editor because it expects a number.
The AttributeCreator transformer allows access to both because it doesn’t rely on a
particular type. It is happy with either numeric or string values.
Secondly, you’re probably wondering why there are math functions inside the text editor
and how you can use them.
That’s simple. The FME function @Evaluate() carries out a mathematical calculation. So
if you need to calculate a numeric value as part of a string, then use that function; like
so:”

**Advantages and Disadvantages**

There are some obvious advantages and disadvantages to using integrated construction of
attributes, compared to a sequence of transformers.

A sequence of transformers is self-documenting.

A casual user could look at the workspace and understand what is happening.
