# Module Review

This chapter looked at User Parameters and some of the more advanced techniques involved in their use.

**What You Should Have Learned from this Module**

The following are key points to be learned from this session:

Theory

- FME is used by both workspace authors and end-users. In general, authors make use of FME parameters; end-users make use of user parameters.
- User parameters accept user input that can be used within a workspace
- User parameters can be linked to FME parameters as an indirect form of control
- Many types of user parameters exist, to allow the user to enter different types of information in a controlled way
- Parameters can be shared to reuse their content in multiple places.
- Parameters can be embedded or scripted to construct complex values from simple input

**FME Skills**

- The ability to use FME parameters and to create user parameters
- The ability to extract information from user parameters and/or link user parameters to FME parameters
- The ability to use complex parameter types such as Choice with Alias, or Attribute Name.
- The ability to use shared, embedded, and private parameters
