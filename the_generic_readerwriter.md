# The Generic Reader/Writer

The Generic Reader and Writer allow FME workspaces to be freed from format restrictions.

**Generic Formats**

FMEâ€™s generic tools are a Reader and Writer that are not tied to a particular format. The Generic Reader is capable of reading almost any format of data, and the Generic Writer is capable of writing almost any format of data.

In that way, a single workspace can be used to process different data formats without being specifically set up for that format.

**The Generic Reader**

Whereas all other Readers are tied to a particular format, the Generic Reader is capable of handling almost any format.
