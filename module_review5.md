# Module Review

This chapter looked at advanced techniques for handling attributes in FME.

**What You Should Have Learned from this Module**

The following are key points to be learned from this session:

**Theory**

- Attributes can be constructed either with a series of transformers or inside a single transformer using Text and Arithmetic editors.
- Constructing an attribute as a series of transformers is more self-documenting, but a single transformer is more elegant and reduces canvas clutter.
- Conditional Values are when an author constructs an attribute according to a number of test conditions.
- Multiple Feature Attributes is a technique where any feature can access the attributes of previous or subsequent features.
- Null attributes are those whose state indicates lack of a value 

**FME Skills**

- The ability to construct attributes with either the Text or Arithmetic editors
- The ability to apply conditional attribute values, and the knowledge to know when this is a good choice of approach
- The ability to use Multiple Feature Attributes.
- The ability to use test for null values, and change values to or from null.
