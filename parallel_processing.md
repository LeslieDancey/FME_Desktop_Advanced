# Parallel Processing

Parallel Processing is a way to improve performance on high-end machines.

**What is Parallel Processing?**

Each FME translation is usually a single process on your computer. Parallel processing is when you decide to transform your data as several simultaneous processes. The fact that they run simultaneously means the whole translation will run several times quicker than it used to.

The idea is to make use of multiple cores on a computer. There are four levels of parallel processing, and each maps to the number of cores in this way:
