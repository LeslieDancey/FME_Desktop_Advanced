# Using Custom Transformers

Custom Transformers aren’t just for tidying a workspace, but also as a way of re-using content.

**Re-Using a Custom Transformer**

Once a custom transformer has been created, its definition is stored in the workspace and can be used any number of times within that workspace.

In fact, a custom transformer that has been created can be placed into the workspace just as any other FME transformer, either through the Transformer Gallery, or by using Quick Add.

Custom transformers can be found in the Transformer Gallery window under a section labelled “Embedded Transformers."

The transformer name, category, and description all appear in the Quick Add tool, so it is definitely worthwhile setting these parameters.

Newly placed instances of a custom transformer will be renamed (or numbered) as necessary, in order to avoid a clash of names.
