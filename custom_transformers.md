# Custom Transformers

Custom Transformers are very powerful tools at either a basic or an advanced level.

**What is a Custom Transformer?**

A custom transformer is a sequence of standard transformers condensed into a single transformer. Any existing sequence of transformers can be turned into a custom transformer.

Custom Transformer Purposes

Among other functions, custom transformers help to:

- Tidy Workspaces

By condensing chunks of content the workspace canvas becomes less cluttered

- Reuse Content

By encapsulating a sequence of transformers in a single object, they can be reused throughout a workspace and shared with colleagues.

- Employ Advanced Functionality

Using a Custom Transformer enables additional functionality to be used, such as looping and parallel processing
