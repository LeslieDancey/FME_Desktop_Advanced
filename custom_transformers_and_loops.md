# Custom Transformers and Loops

Loops are a way to carry out a process that repeats a section of transformers.

**What is a Loop?**

A loop is a programming structure that allows an action to be repeatedly executed.

Often this is used to carry out iteration; where a process repeats to gradually narrow down the process to a desired result. Usually a loop is linked to a condition; i.e. the action continues until a certain condition is met.

“I often get into a loop when flying. I have to circle the airport again and
again (the action), until I have clearance to land (the condition).”
